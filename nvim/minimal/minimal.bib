  abstract =      {This article argues that it is necessary to recognise
                   Sections II.1 and II.3 of the B\d{r}had
                   \=Ara\d{n}yaka Upani\d{s}ad as one discourse. Since
                   nobody among traditional or modern scholars has paid
                   attention to this structure, many problems have been
                   neither seen nor solved. This article does so, and
                   further, exposes textual problems embedded there and
                   analyses them. In this very discourse the expression
                   n\'eti n\'eti is introduced as an \=ade\'sa.
                   Therefore, this article investigates the meaning and
                   function of this expression there. This article also
                   muses on possible implications of the entire
                   discourse of G\=argya and Aj\=ata\'satru.},
